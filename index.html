        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p class="about-njc">
          In 2011 Miracle and James Yoder opened the doors of Not Just Coffee to
          the city of Charlotte, pledging intentionality and passion for every
          cup and every customer. We are dedicated to cultivating a community
          supportive of ethical and locally-driven business. We proudly partner
          with our neighbors at Homeland Creamery and our sister company, Night
          Swim Coffee (www.nightswimcoffee.com), to craft flavorful brews, each
          made with decided precision and care.<br />
          Believing as much in the hand of an educated barista as in the
          innovative equipment of our ever-growing industry, Not Just Coffee
          offers a full spectrum of brewing opportunities â€“ from pour overs to
          finely executed espresso beverages. Through cuppings, classes, and
          interactive brewing our baristas bring the moving, breathing craft of
          coffee to our customers in full color.
