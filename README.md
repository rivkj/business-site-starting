Company Homepage with Flexbox
Objectives:
Using flexbox to design and build the layout for a company’s homepage. You can choose to build a new homepage for an existing company or imagine your own dream company! ​

Include:
A title and logo or splash image.
A mission statement or brief description of the company.
A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
A section describing some of the company’s employees or teammates.
Aim to use Flexbox’s advantages, such as easy horizontal and vertical positioning, flexible element flows as the page size changes, and great styling for repeated elements.
Your page should also use custom styles for other properties, such as colors, fonts, and other layout properties such as borders and padding.

A simple color scheme using CSS named colors, but yours can be more elaborate with hexadecimal, RGB, or HSL colors.
Fonts from the Google Fonts API.
Custom images.

Rendition: A company home page and menu page was done to replicate a coffee shop's home page. Links and additional styling was added to complete the page. Only missing elements that can be added at a different date are a form to receive email information and a contact page that holds the form and additional information.
